To use my app, click on the link:
[My Note Taker](https://legendary-broccoli-11-91c7ca012d8f.herokuapp.com/)

The note taker allows you to write, save, and delete notes as needed. 
Simply fill in your title and note content and click the "Save" icon on the left. Your new note should save to the list on the left. You can click on your previous notes to retrieve them, and when they are no longer needed, the trash icon can delete them.
